# Project Review: Issues & Problematic Patterns

## 1. Error Handling

- Many helpers and main classes (e.g., `streamline-card.js`, `streamline-card-editor.js`) use `throw` or let errors bubble up, but error boundaries or user feedback are minimal. This can cause the UI to break without clear feedback.
- **Suggestion:** Add user-friendly error displays and more granular try/catch blocks, especially around dynamic template loading and evaluation.

## 2. Type Safety

- The main code is JavaScript, but some tests are in TypeScript. There is no type checking in the main logic, which can lead to runtime errors.
- **Suggestion:** Consider migrating core logic to TypeScript or adding JSDoc type annotations for better safety and editor support.

## 3. Caching and Memory

- The use of global caches (e.g., `variableCache`, `functionCache`) is efficient but can lead to memory leaks if not managed, especially in long-running dashboards.
- **Suggestion:** Implement cache size limits or periodic cleanup.

## 4. Template Loading Logic

- The template loading in `streamline-card.js` is complex, with multiple fallbacks and a global `isTemplateLoaded` state. If loading fails, the error is only thrown if `isTemplateLoaded === true`, which may hide issues.
- **Suggestion:** Refactor to make template loading more robust and provide clear error states to the user.

## 5. Direct DOM Manipulation

- Some code directly manipulates the DOM (e.g., `this._shadow.removeChild(this._card)`), which can cause issues if the DOM state is not as expected.
- **Suggestion:** Add checks before DOM operations and consider using a more declarative rendering approach.

## 6. Inconsistent Variable Handling

- Variable formatting and evaluation logic is spread across multiple helpers, and the handling of arrays vs. objects is not always clear.
- **Suggestion:** Unify variable handling and document the expected formats for variables throughout the codebase.

## 7. Potential for XSS

- The use of `new Function` for evaluating JavaScript in templates is powerful but risky. If user-supplied templates are not sanitized, this could be a vector for XSS.
- **Suggestion:** Document this risk and, if possible, restrict or sanitize template input.

## 8. Testing Coverage

- While helper functions are well tested, there is little to no test coverage for the main web components (`streamline-card.js`, `streamline-card-editor.js`).
- **Suggestion:** Add integration tests for the custom elements, possibly using a headless browser or web component testing library.

## 9. Code Duplication

- Some logic (e.g., variable merging, error messages) is duplicated across helpers and components.
- **Suggestion:** Refactor common logic into shared utilities.

## 10. Performance

- The use of `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` for deep cloning and variable replacement is convenient but can be slow for large templates.
- **Suggestion:** Profile performance and consider more efficient deep copy or template processing methods if needed.
